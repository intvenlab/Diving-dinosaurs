         (the label column, any filters applied, etc.)

OPERATIONAL CHECKS:
* Regression data contains multiple copies of some taxa (user added variants of existing test taxa 
   or replacements due to bootstrap are present) which are not in the phylo tree:
     original taxon,   duplicate

"2","Spinosaurus_","Spinosaurus_.2"
"3","Spinosaurus_","Spinosaurus_.3"

* Phylo tree and the main data and strata files have been modified to include duplicated taxa before the scaled random trees are generated.
* Selected categorical labels column: diving.or.not
* diving.or.equal column is identical to Diving column.
* Regression excludes flying taxa.
* Diving labels that are present in regression: 0,2
